# ðŸ§¬ @gengarlax-ui/tokens

This package contains the design tokens (colors, font sizes, spacing, radii, etc.) used across the Gengarlax UI design system.

It is meant to provide consistent styling values across all components.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
npm install @gengarlax-ui/tokens
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

You can import the tokens directly and use them with @stitches/react or any compatible CSS-in-JS/ These tokens are used internally by @gengarlax-ui/react, but you can also use them in your own components to keep a consistent design language.
